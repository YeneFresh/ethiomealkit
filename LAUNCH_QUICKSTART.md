# 🚀 YeneFresh - Launch Quickstart (2-Page Cheat Sheet)

**Status**: ✅ READY TO LAUNCH  
**Time to Deploy**: 15 minutes

---

## ⚡ **Launch in 3 Commands** (Fastest Path)

```bash
# 1. Run production upgrade (Supabase SQL Editor)
# Copy/paste: sql/002_production_upgrades.sql → Run

# 2. Verify database
# Run in Supabase:
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipes) as recipes,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_%') as indexes;
# Should show: recipes=15, indexes=9

# 3. Deploy
flutter build web --release
# Upload to hosting → DONE! 🎉
```

---

## 📋 **10-Minute Preflight** (Verify Before Launch)

### **Database Checks** (Supabase SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Check 1: Recipes = 15
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipes;

-- Check 2: RPCs = 8
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema='app';

-- Check 3: Indexes = 9
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_%';

-- Check 4: Capacity guard works (should error when full)
UPDATE delivery_windows SET booked_count = capacity WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM delivery_windows LIMIT 1);
SELECT app.reserve_window_capacity((SELECT id FROM delivery_windows LIMIT 1)::uuid);
-- Should throw: "No capacity available"
UPDATE delivery_windows SET booked_count = 0; -- Reset
```

### **App Test** (Chrome):

```
1. flutter run -d chrome
2. Complete flow: Welcome → Box → Auth → Delivery → Recipes → Address → Checkout
3. Verify: Order created (check /orders)
4. Switch to dark mode → Verify theme changes
5. All 15 recipe images load (not icons)
```

**All ✅? GO FOR LAUNCH!**

## 🚨 **First 24 Hours** (Monitor These)

### **Metrics to Watch**:
```sql
-- Run every hour
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 hour') as orders_last_hour,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'scheduled') as pending,
  AVG(capacity - booked_count) as avg_remaining_capacity
FROM orders, delivery_windows;
```

### **Alerts** (Set These):
- 🔴 Error rate > 5/min for 5 min → Page on-call
- 🔴 Order success < 95% for 10 min → Page on-call
- 🟡 Funnel drop > 30% → Notify team

---

## 🔥 **If Something Breaks** (Quick Fixes)

### **Orders Not Creating**:
```sql
-- Check user's state
SELECT * FROM user_onboarding_state WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';
SELECT * FROM user_recipe_selections WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';
-- Missing recipes? Check they selected enough for their plan
```

### **Images Not Loading**:
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls assets/recipes/*.jpg | wc -l  # Should be 15

# Check pubspec.yaml has:
# assets:
#   - assets/recipes/
```

### **Capacity Issues**:
```sql
-- Add more capacity
UPDATE delivery_windows SET capacity = capacity + 10 WHERE slot = 'POPULAR_SLOT';

-- Or add new window
INSERT INTO delivery_windows (start_at, end_at, weekday, slot, city, capacity)
VALUES (...);  -- See MONITORING_AND_RUNBOOKS.md
```

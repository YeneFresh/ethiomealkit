## Grand Image Compliance

This PR follows the Grand Image Guardrails:

- [ ] No structural UI changes without flags
- [ ] All routes registered in `screen_registry.yaml`
- [ ] Feature flags used for experimental changes
- [ ] Database migrations are idempotent
- [ ] All tests pass (golden, smoke, gate integrity)
- [ ] No dead buttons or broken CTAs
- [ ] Visual consistency maintained

## Refusal Notice

If this PR attempts to change UI/UX beyond flags or registry, it should be rejected with:

> "Refused structural UI change: violates Grand Image Guardrails (screen_registry.yaml / flags). Propose a design RFC instead."
